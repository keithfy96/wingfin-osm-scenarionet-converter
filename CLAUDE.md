## A. Junction and lane diagrams must be genuinely visual

Whenever you explain lane topology at a node — in a plan, in an answer, or in a doc
— **draw it as a plan-view diagram** in the format shown below. Do not substitute a
table of IDs, a bullet list of mappings, or prose. The reader must be able to see
what is wrong without holding four lane indices in their head or cross-referencing
anything.

**Every diagram must carry, inline:**

- travel direction, and the kerb and centreline edges drawn and labelled
- the index convention in the header — indices run **centre-out**, `idx0` hugs the
  centreline (offside), `idx(n−1)` is kerbside (nearside) — and the angle sign
  convention, `+` = left turn, `−` = right turn
- **every destination lane as its own channel**, labelled `idxN/M`, its lane ID,
  nearside / middle / offside, and its **feed count**
- **every approach labelled where it is drawn** — way ID, `idxN/M`, turn angle, and
  any `turn:lanes` tag or ramp/link role
- shared feeds drawn as a visible merge into one lane
- **starved lanes called out inside the drawing**, not in prose underneath
- no "see the table above", no bare hex IDs the reader has to look up

Re-derive every ID, index, angle and count from the generated model by script
before drawing. Never copy figures by hand from an earlier message.

Both reference cases below show the **pre-v11 model**. The defect they illustrate was
fixed in `direct-osm-stage2-v11` (`_balanced_merge_assignment`), so neither node looks
like this any more — see
`docs/mapping-algo-changes/2026-08-07-12:34:23-merging-approaches-starve-the-middle-lane.md`
for the after view. They are kept because they remain the worked examples of the
required format.

Both cases were the **same defect**, mirrored, and both are now fixed.

## B. Log every corrected mapping-algorithm mistake — automatically

When a mapping-algorithm mistake is corrected, write an entry in
`docs/mapping-algo-changes/` **without being asked**. The folder is a countable
record of real corrections; it must not fill up with session notes.

Filename: `YYYY-MM-DD-HH:MM:SS-<algo-change-desc>.md` (get the timestamp from
`date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H:%M:%S"`, do not invent one).

**Write an entry only when all three hold:**

1. **Keith identified the mistake** — he pointed at a lane, connector or mapping
   that is wrong. Not something you noticed and decided to change.
2. **The fix changed algorithm code** in `src/osm_scenario/` — generation,
   topology, lane mapping. Not docs, config, or tests.
3. **The fix was verified** — workspace regenerated, before/after counts compared,
   no existing connector regressed, `uv run pytest` passes.

**Do not write an entry for:** investigations that ended without a code fix;
doc-, config- or test-only changes; refactors Keith did not flag; attempts that
were reverted; or anything where you are unsure. When unsure, ask — do not create
the file speculatively.

Required headings, so entries stay comparable: **Symptom**, **Fundamental cause**,
**Fix**, **Verification**. The fundamental cause is the point of the record — say
*why the algorithm produced the wrong result*, not merely which line changed. Full
template in `docs/mapping-algo-changes/README.md`.

---

## C. Repo facts you cannot get from reading the source

`README.md` and `guide/project-guide.md` cover Stage 1 only. The Stage 2 generator
is `src/osm_scenario/generation.py`; geometry and movement classification live in
`src/osm_scenario/topology.py`.

### Commands

```bash
uv run osm-scenario generate-map -w workspaces/junction-1 --config config/default.yaml
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check
```

The `-w` is required and easy to miss. `ruff format --check` fails on 8
pre-existing files and is **not** a gate — do not mass-reformat to satisfy it.

### Workspaces

`workspaces/` is gitignored, so its contents never appear in `git status` — run
`ls workspaces/` rather than assuming. `junction-1` is the working one.
Generation refuses to run when `source/map.osm` drifts from the sha256 in
`source/manifest.json`; Keith hand-edits the OSM mid-session, so re-check rather
than trusting a number from earlier in the conversation.

### Reference checkouts — read MetaDrive, do not guess at it

Both are on this machine. Neither is a dependency of this repo, and nothing in
`git status` will remind you they exist.

- `/home/keith/Desktop/work/wingfin/metadrive/` — MetaDrive **0.4.3**, the format
  this converter targets. When a question is "what does MetaDrive do with this
  field", the answer is in here, not in a recollection of the docs.
- `/home/keith/Desktop/work/wingfin/scenarionet/` — ScenarioNet: the dataset
  tooling, and the Waymo / nuPlan / nuScenes / Argoverse converters worth
  comparing our output against when a field's shape is in doubt.

`tests/unit/test_conversion.py` loads MetaDrive's real `ScenarioDescription`
straight from the first path (`METADRIVE_SRC`, near line 356) and is marked
`skipif` on the directory being absent — so a moved or renamed checkout **silently
drops the schema gate** rather than failing.

### Checking a converted dataset, and what it can and cannot do yet

`uv run pytest` cannot tell you the dataset loads. Both checkouts run **Python 3.8
/ numpy 1.24** and this repo runs 3.10 / numpy 2.2, so the interpreter the tests
use is exactly the one where a version fault is invisible. Run it from the other
side instead:

```bash
/home/keith/Desktop/work/wingfin/metadrive/.venv/bin/python \
  tools/check_dataset.py workspaces/junction-1/scenarionet
```

`conversion.py` pickles arrays through `_PortablePickler` precisely because of
that gap — numpy 2 writes a reference to `numpy._core`, which numpy 1 does not
have and 3.8 can never get. **Anything that changes how arrays are written must
keep the stream free of version-specific module names**; two tests in
`test_conversion.py` pin it, one on the pickle stream and one on arrays still
arriving as arrays rather than lists.

### Making a dataset MetaDrive can drive

**`ScenarioEnv` has no start-and-end setting.** It is wired to
`TrajectoryNavigation`, whose whole input is a *recorded* car's positions, and
`ScenarioMapManager.reset` calls `get_sdc_track()` unconditionally — with no ego
car that is `KeyError('None')`, and no config skips it. So a route has to be in
the file, and choosing it is Keith's, not a heuristic's:

```bash
# 1. pick routes: open inspection/stage-6-route-builder.html, click a start lane,
#    click an end lane, name it, add it, download routes.json
# 2. build
uv run osm-scenario convert -w workspaces/junction-1 --config config/default.yaml \
  --routes workspaces/junction-1/routes/routes.json
# 3. drive (MetaDrive's own venv)
/home/keith/Desktop/work/wingfin/metadrive/.venv/bin/python \
  tools/drive.py workspaces/junction-1/scenarionet --render 3D
```

**Use `tools/drive.py`, not `python -m scenarionet.sim`.** `sim.py` loads the same
dataset and drives it correctly, but in 3D it shows a broken map, and none of the
settings that fix that can be reached from it. See "Why 3D needs its own runner"
below.

**MetaDrive never reads `routes.json`.** It is an exchange file between the
browser and our converter — a browser cannot write to disk — exactly as Stage 3
downloads `review.json` for `apply-review --submission`. MetaDrive reads the
pickles and nothing else, and the route inside them *is*
`tracks["ego"]["state"]["position"]`.

Without `--routes` the dataset stays map-only: `scenarionet.num`,
`scenarionet.check_existence` (it passes `steps_to_run=0`, so no simulator) and
`tools/check_dataset.py` all work; `scenarionet.sim` and `check_simulation` do
not.

Two more things that bite here:

- **`sim.py` loops to 1,000,000 scenarios** when `--scenario_index` is absent, so
  it ends with `AssertionError: Scenario Index ... out of range` after driving
  everything. That is their script running off the end, not a fault in the data.
  `tools/drive.py` stops at the end of the dataset.
- **The route builder previews the drive; Python re-derives it.** Both build the
  same geometry, and they agreed to within 3.5 m over 1.1 km on 40 real routes.
  If the two ever disagree the page offers drives the converter refuses, so
  `web/test/route/geometry.test.ts` and `tests/unit/test_ego_route.py` cover the
  same cases deliberately.

### Traffic lights, and why the timing cannot come from OSM

**MetaDrive has no traffic-light controller.** `ScenarioLightManager.after_step` does
one thing — index `state["object_state"]` by `episode_step` and call `set_status` —
and it is the only light manager in 0.4.3; procedurally generated maps carry no
lights at all. A light in a dataset is therefore a **tape**: a colour spelled out for
every 0.1 s step.

**OSM supplies presence, never timing.** `highway=traffic_signals` carries no cycle,
no split and no offset, so every number is chosen by a person in
`inspection/stage-6-signal-builder.html` and the dataset marks the plan
`synthesised` in `metadata.signals`. `junction-1` has exactly **one** signal node,
`1927184932`, and it is at the edge of the extract — node 0 of way `1173001826`, in
no other way, 0 connectors — so Stage 2 bound it to the three lanes it *releases*.
The page draws it and never selects it.

```bash
# 1. place lights: open inspection/stage-6-signal-builder.html, add a phase group,
#    click the lanes it stops, set green/amber/start, download signals.json
uv run osm-scenario convert -w workspaces/junction-1 --config config/default.yaml \
  --routes workspaces/junction-1/routes/routes.json \
  --signals workspaces/junction-1/signals/signals.json
```

Four things that bite:

- **Signal timing must never go in `config/default.yaml`.** `configuration_checksum`
  is an input to `generation_fingerprint` (`generation.py:2212`), so a field on
  `ConverterConfig` invalidates the lane-model review at the next `generate-map`.
  Same for the lane model schema. Timing is a `convert`-time file, like `--routes`.
- **`stop_point` sits at the top level of a light entry, not inside `state`.**
  Everything in `state` is length-checked against the scenario length, and
  `_get_episode_light_data` reads an in-`state` position as the old Waymo `[T, 2]`
  format. Getting this wrong fails only on scenarios that are not 3 steps long.
- **A wrong lane id is silent.** `skip_missing_light` defaults to **True**, so a
  light keyed on something that is not a map feature is dropped with a log line and
  no light. `tools/check_dataset.py` checks every key resolves; nothing else does.
- **A baked tape is the same on every episode**, so an agent learns the step number
  rather than the light. `tools/signal_control.py` drives the same lights from
  `metadata.signals` and one offset drawn per episode — one offset for the *whole*
  plan, because the gaps between groups are what keeps crossing arms apart.
  `tools/drive.py --lights live` runs it; `--lights tape` is the portable default a
  stock ScenarioNet consumer sees.

**The clock is written three times** — `signal_plan.colour_at` for the tape,
`web/src/signal/phase.ts` for the page, `tools/signal_control.py` for the live
manager — because they run on three different interpreters. The offset means **when
green starts**. `tests/unit/test_signal_plan.py` and `web/test/signal/phase.test.ts`
assert the same numbers on purpose.

**To see the ego stop at a red light you must leave replay.**
`--agent-policy idm` selects `TrajectoryIDMPolicy`, which MetaDrive supports for the
ego (`agent_manager.py:49` hands it `current_sdc_route`) and which inherits
`IDMPolicy`'s light check. `ReplayEgoCarPolicy` sets position directly and drives
through anything. Measured on `junction-1` with a light on the route: the ego stops
**5.7 m short** of the red and moves off when it goes green. It also ends early with
`out_of_road` at 4.26 m lateral against `max_lateral_dist=4` — the IDM's lateral
controller losing the reference line, which says nothing about the data and does not
happen under replay.

### Why 3D needs its own runner

2D is fine from any entry point. 3D through `scenarionet.sim` shows roads that stop
and an ego that sinks into the ground and floats — **none of it a defect in the
converted data**, all of it MetaDrive terrain defaults meeting a map shaped like a
road network rather than like a Waymo clip. Three separate causes, each measured:

- **`height_scale` (default 50) is the sinking and the flying.** `use_mesh_terrain`
  is false by default, so the car drives on a flat collision plane at z≈0 while the
  *visible* ground is a noise heightfield around it. `tools/drive.py` measures it:
  at 50 the ground within 25 m of the drive reaches **+10.3 m** and 11% of it stands
  above the road; at 1 it reaches **+0.2 m** and 0% does. Only the surroundings move
  — the road is flattened either way. **0 is not allowed**: panda3d builds a singular
  transform and dies with `Tried to invert singular LMatrix4`.
- **The road-surface texture is often larger than the GPU accepts, and there is no
  config key for it.** MetaDrive builds it at `map_region_size × 22` px square —
  22528 at 1024, **45056 at 2048**. A GL context reports its own ceiling: 16384 on
  an Intel iGPU, 32768 on a discrete card. Past it the texture cannot be uploaded,
  and that is what "the roads stop" looks like. The 22 is hard-coded in
  `TerrainProperty.get_semantic_map_pixel_per_meter`; `tools/drive.py` replaces that
  classmethod at runtime — the only monkeypatch in the repo, and it rides the seam
  `base_env.py:335` already uses for `map_region_size`. Nothing in the MetaDrive
  checkout is edited.
- **`map_region_size` sizes the terrain square, and 2048 is the wrong blanket
  answer** — an earlier version of this file said to set it, which would demand a
  45056 px texture no GPU can hold. The square is `map_region_size` metres centred
  on the ego's start (`base_engine.py:386` hard-codes `center_p = [0, 0]`; the disk
  loader passes `centralize=True`, `scenario_data_manager.py:76`), and outside it
  there is no ground and no flattened road. So it must be *just* big enough:
  `tools/drive.py` measures each scenario and picks the smallest power of two that
  covers it, and `tools/check_dataset.py` reports the same number. `junction-1`'s
  `main-route` reaches 449 m from its start, so 1024 is enough; another start lane
  will not be.

Run `tools/drive.py --render offscreen` to check any of this without a display —
`--render none` builds no terrain at all (`Terrain.reset` guards the whole path on
`self.render or use_mesh_terrain`), so it checks the drive and not the view.

### Conventions that bite

- **OSM connectivity is via shared nodes.** Relations only carry turn restrictions.
  A missing connection is never a missing relation.
- **`direction: forward|backward`** is relative to OSM way node order, not to
  oncoming-ness. A "backward" lane is not necessarily oncoming traffic.
- **Lane indices run centre-out**: `idx0` = offside (against the centreline),
  `idx(n−1)` = nearside (kerbside). `driving_side` is `left`.
- **`signed_turn_angle` is CCW-positive**: `+` = left turn, `−` = right turn.
- **`entry_lanes` / `exit_lanes` hold a mix of ID kinds** — lane IDs for
  continuations (written at `generation.py:1147`) and connector IDs for junction
  movements (248 vs 74 in the current junction-1 model). Any lookup that assumes
  one kind fails silently on the other.

### The standing principle: surveyed tags outrank inferred angles

`turn:lanes` is surveyed evidence of which movements are *permitted*. The movement
class is *inferred* by binning a turn angle against threshold constants. Where the
two disagree, **the tag must never be the reason a lane loses its only exit** —
that cuts the drivable network on the strength of a magic number. Already enforced
in `_side_filtered_candidates` and `_stranded_permission_fallback`; follow the same
rule anywhere else the two sources of truth meet.

### Starved middle lanes: mostly fixed, one left

Two allocation rules now run before the proportional mapping, and between them they
cover both shapes where the lane arithmetic closes:

- `_balanced_approach_assignment` — **one** approach across **several** destinations
  (a lane peeling off cannot also be the straight-on lane). Added in v10.
- `_balanced_merge_assignment` — **several** approaches into **one** destination
  (a merging link must not land on a lane the main road already feeds). Added in v11.

`_mapped_lane_index` (`generation.py`) is unchanged and still **cannot produce a
middle index**: for a 2-lane approach onto a 3-lane destination
`round(idx × (3−1) / (2−1))` gives `idx0→0`, `idx1→2`, and index 1 is unreachable for
*any* input. It now only decides **oversubscribed** approaches — where the counts do
not close, a lane genuinely serves more than one movement, and the ambiguity is
reported rather than resolved. Clean diverges and clean merges no longer go through it.

**Fixed in v17 — the last diagnosed starved lane.** `39619063` idx1/2 `c0530c25fd` at
node 1927184814 is now fed by `027a3ef89e3e7b88`.

Way `756118314` is tagged `turn:lanes=right|right`, so both its lanes carry
`turn_permissions=['right']`. An explicit `turn:lanes` value outranks geometry in
`movement_side()`, so **both** lanes are labelled `offside`, and
`side_lane_index("offside", 2)` returned `0` for both — they collided on one target.
The approach is oversubscribed (2 lanes arriving, 5 lanes of destination capacity at
the node), so neither balanced rule reaches it and `_mapped_lane_index` decides.

`_mapped_lane_index` now takes the block of lanes an explicit tag puts on that side and
deals them from the side inward, so a side says where a block **starts** rather than
where every lane in it goes. A block of one is unchanged, so only a genuine collision
moves. See
`docs/mapping-algo-changes/2026-08-09-16:44:44-a-side-picks-where-a-block-starts.md`.

Two blockers remain at that node, and correctly: `turn:lanes=right|right` names a right
turn that is not available there, and that disagreement is Keith's to judge. **Never fix
a tag-versus-geometry conflict by making the finding stop being raised** — fix the
mapping and keep the review.

Two cautions when re-measuring this. A previous version of this table also listed
`776021087` idx0/2 `8caffc7049` at node 13946726031; under the criterion "no connector
and no continuation names it as a target" that lane was **already fed at v9**, so it
was either counted under a different criterion or listed in error. And `junction-1`
still has **21** lanes fed by nothing; most are network-boundary lanes rather than
defects, and none of the remainder has been diagnosed.
